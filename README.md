# Welcome to the Classic Snake Game
#### Created by Aly Boolani - using the turtle module in Python. 

# About the application
This repository comprises of a simple python script using the turtle module to build the classic snake game. 

This game can be run through the Terminal (Mac) or Command Line (Windows) by running the following command:
`python SnakeGame.py`

The rules for the game are simple and can be played by using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). When the snake touches the boundary of the screen or itself, it will die. There will also be a high score tally being kept on screen that can be seen for the user.
